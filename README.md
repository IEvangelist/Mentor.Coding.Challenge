A few points of advice, and things to consider.

 - Consider using `async` and `await`
 - Find a free weather API, sign up for it to obtain an API key
   - Use said API key and corresponding endpoint to make an `HttpRequest` and retrieve data
   - Map data to known object


- Display results using `ToString` override
- Consider user hitting `Start` button multiple times
